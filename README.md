# datasciencecoursera

A repo for Coursera's Data Science Signature Track's coursework.

Here you can find all my coursework completed during the Data Science specialization. Please note that these solutions might not be correct and definitely are not the most efficient, well-written and well-formatted ones as I am new to R programming so use them accordingly.
